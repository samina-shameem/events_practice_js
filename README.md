#JavaScript Events Practice

This project is a simple way to practice handling various JS events. It demonstrates how to work with:

- Button click event
- Mouse hover (mouseover and mouseout) events
- Keyboard input event (keyup)
- Form submission event

## How to Run

1. Download the project files or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the event interactions.
3. Interact with the elements on the page (buttons, inputs, form) to trigger events.

## File Structure

The project is organized into the following files:events-practice/ 
├── index.html

# The main HTML structure for the project

├── style.css

# CSS for styling the elements

├── script.js

# JavaScript file handling event logic

└── README.md

# Documentation explaining the project

### Explanation of Files
- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the web page, including buttons, a hoverable box, a text input, and a form.
- **style.css**: Defines styles for the page elements like colors, sizes, and layout.
- **script.js**: Includes JavaScript code to add interactivity by listening to events like `click`, `mouseover`, `keyup`, and `submit`.
- **README.md**: This file explains the project, its purpose, and how to run it.

## How to Extend the Project

Here are some ideas to enhance your event-handling practice:

1. Add more events:
   - **Double-click** (`dblclick`)
   - **Change event** (`change`)
   - **Drag and drop** (`dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`)

2. Create new interactive elements:
   - Add a slider and handle its `input` event.
   - Add checkboxes and respond to their `change` events.

3. Use CSS to highlight the element currently being interacted with.


## Learning Objective

The purpose of this project is to get comfortable with:
- Attaching event listeners to HTML elements.
- Responding to user interactions dynamically.
- Managing basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
